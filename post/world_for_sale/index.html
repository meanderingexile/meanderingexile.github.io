<span class="newthought">//Shipping and swashbucklers//The Good Old Days//Opportunity in complexity//</span>

<p>I recently read The World For Sale, an investigation into commodities trading in
the 20th century. While the whole book is a good read, the early chapters in
particular, which deal with the swashbuckling post-WWII days, where traders made
fortunes with chutzpah and instinct.</p>
<p>I found it interesting to reflect a little on what factors made this first big
boom of commodities trading possible: transport, communication, and opportunity.
The most obvious one, and Farchy and Blas explicitly highlight, is networks of
global transport. Shipping of bulk commodities goes back to antiquity, but only
because truly possible at scale in the modern era.</p>

We have evidence of long-range metals transport as far back as the
Bronze Age. The Uluburun shipwreck had a cargo of metals from the late 14th
century BCE, including tin and copper from around the Mediterranean. Other
shipwrecks in the near East have had copper from as far away as ancient
Cornwall.

Lundgren (1996) identified three revolutions in shipping technology over the
19th and 20th centuries. The first was the optimization of wind power. For most
of human history was limited to relatively high-value cargoes like spices,
sugar, and human beings, powered by wind. By the early 19th century, in the
golden age of sail, these technologies had reached their pinnacle, significantly
reducing intercontinental shipping costs compared to previous centuries.</p>
<p>Like every technology, sail power reached its peak just as it was about to be
replaced. In the late 19th century, the first transcontinental steamships
emerged, beginning in North America, but then quickly growing to cross the
Atlantic and then further beyond. This marked the second revolution.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 60s, we see the beginning of the third revolution, where ships
become much larger. Lundgren doesn&rsquo;t draw this connection, but I have to believe
that this would be supported by the improvements in shipbuilding and engineering
from the Second World War. Regardless, bulk carriers get much larger, including
a increase in the number of specialized oil carriers.</p>
<p>All together, this made bulk international transport possible, bringing the
prices of far-flung sources of commodities close enough together that oil from
Kuwait and Texas become valid substitute goods. Firms like Phillipp Brothers
could then make a profit by trading off the difference.</p>
<p>To trade that profitably, traders need an information advantage, which was made
possible by fast communication, with undersea cables connecting signals from
continent to continent. When higher bandwidth was required, early aviation,
primitive by today&rsquo;s standards, shuffled traders and their agents over the
oceans for meetings and fact-finding expeditions.</p>
<p>This information was available, but expensive, and so it could be exploited as a
source of edge. If you had the contacts, the courage, and the determination, you
could obtain that information before other people, and make better decisions, or
at least better gambles.</p>
<p>In their conclusion, Farchy and Blas talk about the golden age of the
swashbuckling commodities trader as coming to a close. One reason they give is
the reversal of the liberalization of international trade in the 2010s, coming
from a rejection of globalization and a rise in populism.</p>
<p>This is strange to me, because most of the stories in the first couple of
chapters involved stories of tradeing across geopolitical boundaries, shipping
metals back and forth across the Iron Curtain. This actually seems like the
third ingredient for the age of commodities high adventure: a complicated
environment with uncertainty, unpredictability, and lots of price/energy
gradients to exploit.</p>
<p>Of these three factors, transport cost, communication cost, and cost surface
complexity, most of the arrows still point in the interesting direction.
Transport costs continue to get cheaper technologically, though the rising cost
of energy threatens to occasionally push things back in the other direction.
Communication has become so cheap, easy, and efficient that the information edge
functionally no longer exists: the only remaining edge is analytical, extracting
signal from information that others fail to process.</p>
<p>That leaves opportunity, and the future is likely to have that in spades. The
return of the multipolar world and increased trade barriers will certainly make
trade less efficient, to the detriment of many, but those same inefficiencies
will create cost differentials, in turn creating opportunity, and a fresh
generation of would be Marc Riches will be there to capture them.</p>
