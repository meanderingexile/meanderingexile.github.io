      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mindell&amp;rsquo;s Digital Apollo is a great book, and not just for the space-obsessed.&#xA;Spaceflight was intertwined with the development of cybernetics, modern control&#xA;systems, and the digital computer. Re-reading it recently while recovering from&#xA;a bout of illness, I found certain themes especially resonant: specifically, the&#xA;role of human beings in semi-automated systems, and the nature of human control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spaceflight emerged from two, often dueling, engineering traditions: missile&#xA;builders, who were used to building entirely automated systems, and aviation,&#xA;which treated instruments as tools for the pilot, and at the time (the 1950s)&#xA;was only begrudgingly admitting the role of autopilots as a way of enhancing the&#xA;pilot&amp;rsquo;s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
