      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never thought of myself as an anxious person, but for a few years fear&#xA;and anxiety became a pretty big part of my life. An increasing number of&#xA;things became stressful, and I made an increasing number of decisions,&#xA;big and small, to avoid those stressors. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of stuff involved in digging out of that hole, but one&#xA;thing that helped a ton was a bit of fortune-cookie wisdom off of Twitter:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;sometimes fear is excitement in disguise&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
