      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s often hard to know what we can do that will matter. The world is complicated, and we only know how things will be affected after the fact. The essence of strategy is to try to find leverage points, places and times that matter, where a small amount of effort can have a big impact.
I think that one of those points is a physical location where we can shape the direction of the coming years: the shadowed, icy bottoms of the craters that cluster near the lunar north and south poles.</description>
